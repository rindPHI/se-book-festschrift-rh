		  program transformation rules, as used in refactoring,

		  generalization of automated cost analysis that can handle
		  abstract programs and, hence, can analyze the impact on the
		  cost of program transformations. This kind of relational
		  property requires provably precise cost bounds which are
		  not always produced by cost analysis. Therefore, we certify
		  by deductive verification that the inferred abstract cost
		  bounds are correct and sufficiently precise. It is the
		  first approach solving this problem. Both, abstract cost
		  analysis and certification, are based on quantitative
		  abstract execution (QAE) which in turn is a variation of
		  abstract execution, a recently developed symbolic execution
		  technique for abstract programs. To realize QAE the new
		  concept of a cost invariant is introduced. QAE is
		  implemented and runs fully automatically on a benchmark set

  Abstract	= {Invariants are a standard concept for reasoning about

		  For real-world languages like Java, loop invariant rules
		  tend to become extremely complex. The main reason is

		  and continue statements, possibly combined and nested
		  inside inner loops and try blocks. We propose the concept
		  of a loop scope which gives rise to a new approach for the
		  design of invariant rules. This permits “sandboxed”
		  deduction-based symbolic execution of loop bodies which in
		  turn allows a modular analysis even of complex loops. Based
		  on the new concept we designed a loop invariant rule for

		  are (1) much increased comprehensibility, which made it
		  considerably easier to argue for its soundness, (2) simpler
		  and easier to understand proof obligations, (3) a
		  substantially decreased number of symbolic execution steps
		  and sizes of resulting proofs in a representative set of

  Abstract	= {Detecting regression bugs in software evolution, analyzing
		  side-channels in programs and evaluating robustness in deep
		  neural networks (DNNs) can all be seen as instances of
		  differential software analysis, where the goal is to
		  generate diverging executions of program paths. Two
		  executions are said to be diverging if the observable
		  program behavior differs, e.g., in terms of program output,
		  execution time, or (DNN) classification. The key challenge
		  of differential software analysis is to simultaneously
		  reason about multiple program paths, often across program
		  variants. This paper presents HyDiff, the first hybrid
		  approach for differential software analysis. HyDiff
		  integrates and extends two very successful testing
		  techniques: Feedback-directed greybox fuzzing for efficient
		  program testing and shadow symbolic execution for
		  systematic program exploration. HyDiff extends greybox
		  fuzzing with divergence-driven feedback based on novel cost
		  metrics that also take into account the control flow graph
		  of the program. Furthermore HyDiff extends shadow symbolic
		  execution by applying four-way forking in a systematic
		  exploration and still having the ability to incorporate
		  concrete inputs in the analysis. HyDiff applies divergence
		  revealing heuristics based on resource consumption and
		  control-flow information to efficiently guide the symbolic
		  exploration, which allows its efficient usage beyond
		  regression testing applications. We introduce differential
		  metrics such as output, decision and cost difference, as
		  well as patch distance, to assist the fuzzing and symbolic
		  execution components in maximizing the execution
		  divergence. We implemented our approach on top of the
		  fuzzer AFL and the symbolic execution framework Symbolic
		  PathFinder. Weillustrate HyDiff on regression and
		  side-channel analysis for Java bytecode programs, and
		  further show how to use HyDiff for robustness analysis of
		  neural networks.},

		  strategies for random (R) and systematic (S0) testing,
		  where each sampling is associated with a sampling cost: 1
		  and c units of time, respectively. The two most important
		  goals of software testing are: (i) achieving in minimal
		  time a given degree of confidence x in a program's
		  correctness and (ii) discovering a maximal number of errors

		  show that there exists a bound on c beyond which R performs
		  better than S0 on the average. Moreover for (i), this bound
		  depends asymptotically only on x. We also show that the
		  efficiency of R can be fitted to the exponential curve.
		  Using these results we design a hybrid strategy H that
		  starts with R and switches to S0 when S0 is expected to
		  discover more errors per unit time. In our experiments we

  Abstract	= {Traditionally, methods such as binary analysis, symbolic

		  strongly geared towards discovering existing
		  vulnerabilities, rather than use in the development cycle
		  to prevent vulnerabilities from arising. Unit testing, in
		  contrast, is firmly in place as part of the development
		  cycle, but is usually very limited in its ability to
		  explore "deep" paths in a system, or expose completely
		  un-anticipated aspects of system behavior. Incorporating
		  the tools used for vulnerability discovery into the
		  development cycle requires large expansion in the expertise
		  that developers must possess, and significant changes in
		  their practices. DeepState is an open-source tool that
		  provides a Google Test-like API to give C and C++
		  developers push-button access to symbolic execution
		  engines, such as Manticore and angr, and fuzzers, such as
		  Dr. Fuzz. Rather than learning multiple complex tools,
		  developers can learn one (familiar) interface for defining
		  a test harness, and can use tools built to find security
		  vulnerabilities to automatically generate more powerful
		  unit tests for software, in an approach that merges
		  traditional unit testing, security analysis methods, and
		  property-based testing. This tutorial will show how to use
		  DeepState in development, including to produce complex
		  library and API tests, and how to take advantage of both
		  the ability to easily apply multiple security-oriented
		  back-ends for test generation during development and the
		  novel strategies for improving back-end performance
		  provided by DeepState.},
