    "Loops are a standard obstacle in symbolic execution. The dynamic / concolic variants of SE use concrete inputs as guides, which ensures the termination of the analysis even in the presence of symbolic loop guards. In static SE, termination is easiest ensured by *bounded* unwinding (see {ref}`foundations:symbolic_interpreter`). However, this impedes the construction of an *exhaustive* symbolic execution procedure, as generally some loop paths will not be covered (if the number of loop executions is not bound by a constant)."
